# K1C 2025 Root Exploit

Creality made the decision to remove the built-in root option from the 2025 model of the K1C, among other changes.

We're a long way off having a `helper-script` for this model, but at least this is the first step in the process. If anybody is interested in helping out with that, all help is appreciated!

# Usage
*On Windows, WSL is recommended.*

1. Download the script.
2. Generate a new RSA key by running `ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -f ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa`. 
3. If prompted for a passphrase, just press enter.
4. Install python3.
5. Install the dependencies: `pip install websocket-client`
6. Execute the script, replacing `[PRINTER_IP]` and `[HOST_IP]` with the IP address of your printer and current device (running the script) respectively: `python3 k1c-2025-exploit.py  --host-ip [HOST_IP] --printer-ip [PRINTER_IP] --public-key ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub`
7. You should see the printer downloading each of the files, and eventually a success message. If it hangs at `[*] Sending trigger:...` your firewall might be blocking requests to the web server started by the script.
8. SSH into the machine: `ssh root@[PRINTER_IP]`.
9. Enjoy your root!

*Note: Each reboot, the printer will generate a new host key. Attempting to SSH again may give a warning about the host key changing. This is fine, just remove the entry from `~/.ssh/known_hosts` as it explains.*

## ⚠️ Warning ⚠️
THERE IS CURRENTLY NO FIRMWARE RECOVERY FOR THIS DEVICE. BE CAREFUL WHAT FILES YOU MODIFY OR RISK BRICKING YOUR PRINTER.
